\section{Experiments results Database }\label{ch5:database}

The main objective of this study was to propose an evaluation of three failure criteria for a selected rock, Dunnville Sandstone. As explained in the previous chapters, their empirical nature requires a thick database of diverse multi axial experiments for their development. 

Dunnville Sandstone have been used for several works in the past and particularly for multi axial experiments \cite{Labuz2018}\cite{Zeng2019}\cite{Tarokh2016}. The ones performed in the scope of this study (cf. Chapter \ref{ch4:title}) presented the opportunity to enrich the existing tests results database and to evaluate the failure criteria with data representative of Dunnville Sandstone response.

The database presented in Table \ref{tb5:database} was based on the one proposed by Zeng et al. (2019) \cite{Zeng2019}, and extended with the results of the experiments from this study. In this table, each experiment is associated with the following elements: the orientation of the bedding regarding the application of the axial stress, the three principal stresses (i.e. $\sigma_I$,$\sigma_{II}$,$\sigma_{III}$) and the stress invariants (i.e.$p$, $q$, $\theta$)

This database was used for the evaluation of Mohr-Coulomb,Hoek-Brown and Paul-Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria, that will be presented in the following sections.

\section{Bi-linear Paul-Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion}\label{ch5:PMC}

Published data from rock testing in conventional triaxial and multi axial testing showed that the failure envelop is non-linear. This non-linearity can be approximated by fitting the experiments data using two planes instead of one, resulting in six parameters describing the envelop. 

The six-parameters fitting splits the data points in two sets in order to create two planes. These planes will give a better approximation of the failure envelop. The fitting procedure presented in 4.3.1. should then be applied to the two set of data points, resulting in different values of $\phi_c$,$\phi_e$ and $V_0$ for each plane.
